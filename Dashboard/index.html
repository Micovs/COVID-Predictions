    <p>In response to tackling the Coronavirus pandemic, countries across the world have implemented a number of different policies, including; 'stay-at-home orders', work place closures (with many employees working from home), school closures (online teaching being adopted by many schools) as well as restrictions on social gatherings, public transportation, and cancellations of large events. Such measures were taken in order to slow the spread of the virus through limiting public movement and interactions. What impact did these restrictions had on US citizens' movements around the country?</p>

    <p>There was a significat drop on mobilty across the US as the number of COVID cases increased from March.As the number of confirmed cases began to decline and stay at home orders were lifted, mobility gradually recovered. You can explore in more detail from our project <strong>COVID Trends</strong> <a href="https://project3-dashboard.herokuapp.com/index.html">The impact of COVID-19 on US mobility, small business revenue and number of COVID cases per state.</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a significant drop in mobility, small business revenue and consumer spending.  There have also been observable highs and lows in the number of cases and deaths both in the US and globally. As a team, we take a data-driven approach to understand the impact of COVID-19.</p>
