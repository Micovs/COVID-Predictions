# COVID-Predictions

## Project Overview

Understanding the spread of COVID-19 is a critical task to mitigate the virus. The global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems, and caused widespread social and economic disruption. What we know so far is there are multiple social and environmental factors influencing the spread. Our focus was to predict the number of ventilators needed as Coronavirus cases rise. Data was sourced from the COVID Tracking Project and CDC for training and testing the models. All our data comes from state and territory public health authorities or official statements from state officials and included daily positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and number of patients on ventilators. After data cleanup, we tested and evaluated different machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, and neural networks.

## Data: COVID Tracking Project
The COVID tracking Project released a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time. Users can view the data to compare US COVID cases, testing, deaths and recovery.
